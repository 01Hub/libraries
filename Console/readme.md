# ![](../assets/Console.png) Console

Static assembler library (x86 and x64) for console usage

The library was created for my own convenience and ease of use.

Basic documentation on the functions in the libraries are located on the wiki: 
* [Console-x86-Functions](https://github.com/mrfearless/libraries/wiki/Console-x86-Functions)
* [Console-x64-Functions](https://github.com/mrfearless/libraries/wiki/Console-x64-Functions)
