# ![](../assets/RPC.png) RPC

Static assembler library (x86 and x64) for Remote Procedure Calls

The library was created for my own convenience. 

Basic documentation on the functions in the libraries are located on the wiki: 
* [RPC-x86-Functions](https://github.com/mrfearless/libraries/wiki/RPC-x86-Functions)
* [RPC-x64-Functions](https://github.com/mrfearless/libraries/wiki/RPC-x64-Functions)

The latest downloadable releases are available [here](https://github.com/mrfearless/libraries/releases)
